Pebble application to display Austin Metro bus arrival time estimates

I decided to learn to write Pebble applications, in order to create an app which will show me when the next few busses are scheduled to arrive at a given stop.

When looking at a schedule, up and down will switch your view to the previous / next stop you have saved in your list. The select button brings up a menu of all of your saved stops, along with an option to add a new stop. A long press on the menu entry for a stop lets you delete it.
