Pebble application to display Austin Metro bus arrival time estimates

I decided to learn to write Pebble applications, in order to create an app which will show me when the next few busses are scheduled to arrive at a given stop.

Currently, there is no way to input which stops you are interested in, but that will come soon. Ideally you could enter it via the watch itself, and also via the application settings menu on the phone. If I get lazy it may just stay the way it is because it has the two stops I actually care about. I guess we'll see!
